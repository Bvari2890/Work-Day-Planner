## Description
In this assignment the goal was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

- Our motivation was to make the a daily planner to manage our time effectively.
- Our goal was to have the app run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
- I was unable to solve the issue of local storage as well as add the times in with either javascript or jQuery.
